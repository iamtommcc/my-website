# Slate 
A nifty bunch of boilerplate that serves as a great base for front-end projects. This was created for my own personal convenience, so it's very rough around the edges. If people *actually use this thing* I'll be sure to improve it.

It's pretty basic, to be honest, but here's what you get:
* SASS
* Autoprefixer
* Browser Sync
* Normalize.css & Susy for a simple, unopinonated kickstart
* All powered by Gulp.


## Installation

Requires Node & NPM. 

Clone to download the repo, navigate to it, and run `npm install`. When you're ready to begin coding, just type `gulp`. Gulp will auto compile your SASS and autoreload your browser thanks to Browser Sync

## Roadmap

* Tidy up folder structure
* Add more comments
* Find a new grid system. Susy is incredible, but it adds 20ms to SASS compile per instance of `span()`. No bueno.
